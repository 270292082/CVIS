# SCENARIO A : NZ COVID Vaccine Information System 
NZ government is developing a vaccine information system where users can view their COVID-19 records, including test and vaccine records. This will be called My Covid Record, including COVID-19 history records, test results, vaccine information, and digital vaccination certificates. This tool can generate a unique QR code that will display users' test and vaccination records for verification by other businesses. This tool will allow users to download digital vaccination and COVID-19 test certificates used in New Zealand and overseas.

### Requirements:
The application can be implemented as a typical desktop, mobile, or cross-platform application. The students can choose their programming language and develop different UI designs. Following is the list of some of the functional requirements for the vaccine information system. The students are encouraged to do some research to identify further functional/non-functional requirements:

1. Users should be able to create a new account or log into the system.
2. The Administrator should be able to log in to the system.
3. The Administrator should be able to view and modify users' information.
4. The Administrator should be able to upload and maintain users' documents.
5. After logging in, users should be able to view their details in the system.
6. After logging in, users should be able to view their COVID-19 tests and vaccine records.
7. The system/ administrator should be able to upload a unique QR code, and logged in users should be able to view their unique QR code for entry requirements.
8. Users should be able to report issues they would encounter in the system.
9. The system should log messages in three different files for the following:

    When certificates are uploaded.
    When the test results are uploaded.
    When users report issues.

10.  The Administrator can change the vaccination status to “Completed” when the user has received both doses. The other available status are: “Unvaccinated” (in case if they haven’t received even a single dose), “Partial” (if they have received one dose).
